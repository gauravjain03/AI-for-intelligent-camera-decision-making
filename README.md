# AI for Intelligent Camera Decision Making

## Project Overview
This project is developed as part of the Rajasthan Police Hackathon 1.0 2024. It aims to enhance surveillance in complex environments through intelligent camera decision-making. The system utilizes high-resolution cameras, depth sensors, and real-time image processing to autonomously identify threats, track objects, and optimize security responses in dynamic settings such as crowded urban areas or large-scale facilities.

## Statement of Problem
Develop an AI system for intelligent camera decision-making to enhance surveillance in complex environments, utilizing high-resolution cameras, depth sensors, and real-time image processing. This system aims to autonomously identify threats, track objects, and optimize security responses in dynamic settings, such as crowded urban areas or large-scale facilities.

## Solution
1. **AI-enabled surveillance cameras:**
   Equipped with facial recognition and behavior analysis to monitor police station activities. Integrating access control systems and inmate monitoring with AI algorithms allows for real-time tracking of personnel, visitors, and detainees, ensuring enhanced security and activity logging.

2. **Monitoring the Movements of Prisoners:**
   AI cameras monitor prisoners in the jail, detect their eye contacts, and track their every movement. The system observes communication frequency and duration. If any suspicious conditions arise, a clear message is sent to the server using the cameraâ€™s assistance.

3. **Prevent Unauthorized Communication and Cybersecurity Threats:**
   If a prisoner procures a phone and uses a hotspot, pre-installed data for all IP addresses used in the police station and its premises will be checked. Any detection of unauthorized IP addresses for WiFi usage will trigger a notification from the AI camera to the server.

4. **Advanced AI Camera Systems for Real-Time Threat Detection and Police Notifications:**
   The AI-powered camera detects metals, assesses their size to determine if it's a knife, a gun, or another object, and sends alerts to police personnel's phones without triggering a buzzer or alarm, enabling peaceful apprehension.

5. **Deploy a Centralized AI System:**
   Integrate multiple cameras with advanced algorithms for person recognition, gesture analysis, and anomaly detection. Utilize machine learning to classify actions, assess behavior patterns, and provide real-time alerts for suspicious activities while ensuring privacy compliance.
